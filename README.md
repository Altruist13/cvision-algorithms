cvision-algorithms
==================

Collection of Computer Vision algorithms implemented in Matlab.

Algorithms:
- seam carving ("Seam carving for content-aware image processing" by S. Avidan & A. Shamir, 2007)
Algorithm and code are described in details http://kirilllykov.github.io/blog/2013/06/06/seam-carving-algorithm/
- bilateral filter ("Bilateral filtering for gray and color images" by C. Tomasi & R. Manduchi, 1998)
- fast bilateral filter ("A fast approximation of the bilateral filter using a signal processing approach" by S. Paris & F. Durand, 2006)
- retinex ("Retinex by two bilateral filters" by M. Elad, 2005)
- shape from shading algorithm by Horn and Ikeuchi, the algorithm description can be found in "The Variational Approach to Shape from Shading"
by B. Horn and M. Brooks, 1985
